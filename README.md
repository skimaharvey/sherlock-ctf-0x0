32 participants selected from Secureum bootcamp were locked in a 7-day battle to hack each otherâ€™s contracts.

The top 32 performers on the Secureum bootcamp quiz were selected to participate in a unique kind of blockchain CTF. Each participant created a contract that is possible but VERY difficult to hack. Over the course of the 7 days, each participant tried to hack as many of their fellow students' contracts as possible.

Each participant started with a maximum of 8 points (depending on the completeness of their submission). A participant earns 1 point for each contract they are able to hack. Extra points were awarded for creative and unintended hacks of others' contracts.
